# 🦀 Rust Notes 🚀

Welcome to my **Rust programming language** notes repository!  
This repo contains all my practice code, experiments, and small examples while I'm learning Rust.  

I use **Cargo** 🦀 to run my programs.  
How you choose to run them is totally **your call** — do your own research and set up what fits you best.  
I'm just sharing **how I personally run my code** ⬇️

## ⚡ How I Run My Code

### ▶️ Run the **main file**
```bash
cargo run
```

### 🧩 Run an **example file** (All Notes are here)
```bash
cargo run --example <file_name>
```
